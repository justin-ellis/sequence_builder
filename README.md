Yoga Sequence Builder App

As a visitor to the site I want to be able to search yoga postures and see their pictures, names, and difficulty level.

As a registered user I want to be able to add postures to a sequence with an appropriate difficulty level.

As a registered user I want to update and delete my sequences.

As a registered user I want to be able to scroll through my sequence and have the current pose be the focal point.

Depending on the type of class (yin, vinyasa, or hatha), I want to see a sequence's estimated duration. 

As registered user I want to be able to browse other user's sequences. 


MVP:
-Hosted on heroku or bought domain
-Link to app in README
-More/less info is displayed underneath a pose's picture if a button is clicked
-Sequence can be displayed as a carousel/slideshow, or in its entirety
-App is user-friendly on a phone (@media queries)
-Full CRUD for sequences
-Bootstrap styling


Stretch: -Have a "swap" feature that will offer an alternative for a selected pose(harder/easier than default pose)
