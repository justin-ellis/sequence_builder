Welcome to Yoga Bloom! The purpose of this app is to catalog information about yoga asanas, or postures, and to give students and teachers the ability to build their own sequence of poses to practice and share with others. Searching the database is available to all visitors of the site, but you must register to be able to create a sequence.
